# Installing `Git`

## Linux

Most Linux distributions will ship with `Git` already installed. To see which version is installed, open a terminal and type `git --version`. If `Git` is not installed, follow the instructions you find [here](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

## OSX

The latest version of OSX installs `Git` automatically. To see which version is installed, open a terminal and type `git --version`. If `Git` is not installed, follow the instructions you find [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

## Windows

To install `Git` and `Git Bash` in Windows, first download the file [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win), then install it. You can use all the default settings for the installation, but we recommend choosing *Use Git from Git Bash Only* and *Checkout as-is, commit as-is* when prompted for these choices. You can then access all `Git` functionalities from the application `Git Bash`.
