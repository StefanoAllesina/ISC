Data description:

* HITChip.tab: a tab-separated text file containing HITChip
  phylogenetic microarray data matrix for 1006 western subjects with
  altogether 1172 samples x 130 genus-like groups. The data provides
  the absolute HITChip signal estimate, preprocessed with min-max
  normalization and fRPA probe summarization as described in the main
  article and references. 

* Metadata.tab: a tab-separated text file containing the
  metadata for the samples in the HITChip data matrix. Most variables
  are rounded or aggregated to ensure subject anonymity. The 'NA'
  refers to missing values. The variable units and other information
  are as follows:
  - SampleID: unique sample identified corresponding to the samples in
    the HITChip data matrix
  - Age (years; rounded to the closest integer)
  - Sex (male/female)
  - Nationality: at the level of geographic regions; for
    details see the main article
  - DNA_extraction_method (r: Repeated Bead Beating, o: other)
  - ProjectID: project identifier; samples are aggregated from many projects
  - Diversity: Shannon diversity index based on probe-level signals
  - BMI_group: Standard body-mass index classification (underweight:
       <18.5; lean: 18.5-25; overweight: 25-30; obese: 30-35; severe
       obese: 35-40; morbid obese 40-45; superobese >45) 
  - SubjectID: Subject identifier (some subjects have multiple time points)
  - Time: Time point (months from the baseline). Most samples have
    only the baseline (0) time point
