## Downloading

To download the repository, you have two options:

1. **Download the zip file**.
Click [here](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/ISC/archive/master.zip), open the zip file, and extract it to your home directory (`/home/yourname` in Linux; `/users/yourname` in OSX; for Windows, choose `C:\Users\yourname`). To make it simpler to follow the text, rename the directory to `ISC` (you should have `ISC-master` by default). Every time you want to update the files to the latest version, you will need to download the zip again.

2. **Clone the repository**. If you have installed `git`, you can clone the repository by opening a terminal (in Linux Ubuntu press `CTRL+ALT+T`; in OSX find the `Terminal` Application in Spotlight; if you are using Windows, first install Git (instructions are [here](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/ISC/blob/master/git/installation/install.md)), then open the `Git Bash` application), then change directory to your home, and clone the repository:
```
cd ~
clone https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/ISC.git
```
To update all the files in the repository, run:
```
cd ~/ISC
git pull
```
