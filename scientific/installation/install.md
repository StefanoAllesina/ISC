# Installing Python packages for scientific computing

## Numpy, SciPy and Pandas

If you followed the instructions and installed Anaconda, these packages are already installed automatically.

For other types of installation, please follow the instructions [here](http://www.scipy.org/install.html).

## Biopython
To install using Anaconda, open a terminal (in Windows, open `Anaconda promt`), and type

```
conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/anaconda biopython
```
